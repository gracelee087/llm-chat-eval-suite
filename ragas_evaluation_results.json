      "question": "How do you calculate payback period?",
      "answer": "The calculation for the payback period is not explicitly available in the provided context. However, generally, it is calculated by dividing the initial investment by the annual cash inflow. The payback period measures the amount of time it takes for an investment to generate cash flows sufficient to recover the initial investment cost. It provides a simple way to assess the risk and liquidity of an investment, with a shorter payback period indicating quicker recovery of the investment.",
