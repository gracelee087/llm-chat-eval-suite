      "question": "How do you calculate payback period?",
      "answer": "The payback period is calculated by determining the amount of time it takes for an investment to generate enough cash flow to recover its initial cost. This is done by:\n\n1. Summing the annual cash flows generated by the investment until the cumulative cash flow equals the initial investment.\n2. Identifying the point in time when the cumulative cash flow becomes positive.\n\nThe payback period is a straightforward measure of investment recovery but does not account for the time value of money or cash flows beyond the payback period.",

      "question": "What is the profitability index?",
      "answer": "The profitability index (PI) is a financial metric that measures the relative profitability of an investment, calculated as the present value of future cash flows divided by the initial investment cost. In mathematical terms:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profitability Index (PI)} = \\frac{\\text{Present Value of Future Cash Flows}}{\\text{Initial Investment}} \\]\n\nA PI greater than 1.0 indicates that the present value of future cash flows exceeds the initial investment, suggesting a potentially profitable investment. A PI less than 1.0 suggests that the investment's returns do not cover its costs.",
